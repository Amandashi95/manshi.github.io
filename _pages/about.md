I'm a postdoc researcher in Electronic Engineering from School of EECS, UC Berkely.

My research focuses on:
▶  Hardware architecture, and computing system for sparse DNN inference
▶  AI accelerator design space exploration framework and performance modeling
▶  Efficient hardware architecture for large language models (LLMs)
